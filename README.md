🧠 Machine Learning Model Implementation

This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model using Scikit-learn to classify or predict outcomes from a dataset.
The example implemented here is a Spam Email Detection model that classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam).

🚀 Features

📊 Loads and preprocesses text dataset

🔤 Uses TF-IDF Vectorization for text feature extraction

🤖 Trains a Logistic Regression model for spam detection

📈 Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall & F1-score

💾 Saves trained model for later predictions

⚙️ Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-model.git
cd machine-learning-model

2️⃣ Install Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Dataset

Add a dataset file inside the data/ folder named spam.csv with the following columns:

Column	Description
label	Class name — spam or ham
message	The email or SMS text

Example:

label,message
ham,Hello, how are you?
spam,WINNER! You have won a $1000 gift card. Click here!

🧠 Model Training

Run the training script:

python src/train_model.py


This will:

Train the model using Logistic Regression

Display accuracy and classification report

Save the model as spam_model.pkl

💬 Make Predictions

Once the model is trained, you can test messages using:

python src/predict.py


Then enter a message like:

Enter a message: Congratulations! You’ve won a free trip.
Prediction: Spam

🔮 Future Improvements

Try other models (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM)

Implement Deep Learning models (LSTM, BERT)

Add Flask or Streamlit UI for predictions

Train on larger or multilingual datasets# Machine-Learning-Model-Implementation
